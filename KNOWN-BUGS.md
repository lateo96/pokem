# Known bugs

1. The last floor of a dungeon can always be selected, even if you can't make a mission there (for example, floor `99` of *Purity Forest*).
2. A *Find item* mission can be generated even if, while the item can be found in the desired dungeon, it cannot be found in the requested floor or in any floor before it.
