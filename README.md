## AUTHOR'S ORIGINAL NOTES:

### Portability tips:
* Avoid using fast assembler instructions, compiler's built-in functions and others things that can reduce portability.
* Use pure and neutral ANSI C Standard Library.

### Good programming practices:
* Follow the whole program indentation style and brackets:
    1. Indent using spaces instead of tabs. Moderns code editor allows you to setting that.
    2. Use 4 spaces indentation.
    3. In functions, the opening bracket is located at the beginning of the line next to the function signature.
    4. In for loops, switches, if statements, etc., the opening bracket is located after a space next to the respective statement.
    5. Warnings must be errors for you.
* Follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.
* In a function that reads from one or more parameters and writes to one or more, receive the read-only parameters last, and the write-only parameters first. This follows a world-wide logic convention pattern that anyone can understand and keep in mind while working in the code of someone else.

### General suggestions:
* Calling performance is not everything. You must focus on maintenance, re-usability and portability.
